          <h1>Solar Panels like <em>nowhere</em> else</h1>
          <p>Solar panels turn the sun's energy into usable electricity. Solar panels – also known as <strong>photovoltaics (PV)</strong> – contain electrons, which start moving when hit with direct sunlight. The moving electrons create an electric current, kind of like a stream of energy, which is then channelled and turned into usable electricity. The electricity is then sent out of the solar panel through wires, ready to power your gadgets, lights or even your electric vehicle, or it can be sent back to the grid, with suppliers paying you for that energy. <strong>Rolsa Technologies</strong> offers<em> cutting edge</em></strong> solar panels starting from just £6000 </p>

          <p>Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us. Fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are <strong>non-renewable</strong> resources that take hundreds of millions of years to form. </p>
          <p>Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Transitioning from fossil fuels, which currently account for the lion’s share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to addressing the climate crisis.</p>
          <p>Renewables are now cheaper in most countries, and generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels.</p>

          <div class="content">
            <p>Hydropower harnesses the energy of water moving from higher to lower elevations. It can be generated from reservoirs and rivers. Reservoir hydropower plants rely on stored water in a reservoir, while run-of-river hydropower plants harness energy from the available flow of the river.

              Hydropower reservoirs often have multiple uses - providing drinking water, water for irrigation, flood and drought control, navigation services, as well as energy supply.
              
              Hydropower currently is the largest source of renewable energy in the electricity sector. It relies on generally stable rainfall patterns, and can be negatively impacted by climate-induced droughts or changes to ecosystems which impact rainfall patterns.
              
              The infrastructure needed to create hydropower can also impact on ecosystems in adverse ways. For this reason, many consider small-scale hydro a more environmentally-friendly option, and especially suitable for communities in remote locations..</p>

            <p>Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources and can even be harnessed in cloudy weather. The rate at which solar energy is intercepted by the Earth is about 10,000 times greater than the rate at which humankind consumes energy.

              Solar technologies can deliver heat, cooling, natural lighting, electricity, and fuels for a host of applications. Solar technologies convert sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic panels or through mirrors that concentrate solar radiation.
              
              Although not all countries are equally endowed with solar energy, a significant contribution to the energy mix from direct solar energy is possible for every country.
              
              The cost of manufacturing solar panels has plummeted dramatically in the last decade, making them not only affordable but often the cheapest form of electricity. Solar panels have a lifespan of roughly 30 years, and come in variety of shades depending on the type of material used in manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Ocean energy derives from technologies that use the kinetic and thermal energy of seawater - waves or currents for instance -  to produce electricity or heat.

              Ocean energy systems are still at an early stage of development, with a number of prototype wave and tidal current devices being explored. The theoretical potential for ocean energy easily exceeds present human energy requirements.</p>
